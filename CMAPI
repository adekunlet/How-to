# used to build the cmapi

#start with to create package.json file all the information about the project and dependencies
#no need to use --save in newer versions on node
npm init

#where we have a carat^ it will download whatever specific version we want
#using npm install express@4.16.4 to install a specific version of a dependency
npm install express

#create a new file called app.js this is where most of the code sits

#install some tooling
# eslint to ensure we are writing code the proper way "-D adds the dependency to local project.
npm i eslint -D # this adds it as a dependency
npm run lint -- --init # this sets upo lint
npm run lint # to execute the code to find errors 

# when you run something from scripts section in package.json file it looks in the local project first for dependencies to run etc.. thats why we add lint to the sxcripts section.
npm install nodemon # handles environmental stop and start stuff.

# create a json file with the data to be inserted intp mongodb
