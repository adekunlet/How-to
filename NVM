# Install the version that you would like 
nvm install 6.1.0

https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage

Usage
To download, compile, and install the latest release of node, do this:

nvm install node # "node" is an alias for the latest version
To install a specific version of node:

nvm install 6.14.4 # or 10.10.0, 8.9.1, etc
The first version installed becomes the default. New shells will start with the default version of node (e.g., nvm alias default).

You can list available versions using ls-remote:

nvm ls-remote
And then in any new shell just use the installed version:

nvm use node
Or you can just run it:

nvm run node --version
Or, you can run any arbitrary command in a subshell with the desired version of node:

nvm exec 4.2 node --version
You can also get the path to the executable to where it was installed:

nvm which 5.0
In place of a version pointer like "0.10" or "5.0" or "4.2.1", you can use the following special default aliases with nvm install, nvm use, nvm run, nvm exec, nvm which, etc:

node: this installs the latest version of node
iojs: this installs the latest version of io.js
stable: this alias is deprecated, and only truly applies to node v0.12 and earlier. Currently, this is an alias for node.
unstable: this alias points to node v0.11 - the last "unstable" node release, since post-1.0, all node versions are stable. (in SemVer, versions communicate breakage, not stability).

#NVM with NPM

nvm now has a command to update npm. It's nvm install-latest-npm or nvm install --latest-npm.

nvm install-latest-npm: Attempt to upgrade to the latest working npm on the current node version

nvm install --latest-npm: After installing, attempt to upgrade to the latest working npm on the given node version

Below are previous revisions of the correct answer to this question.

Over three years after this question was first asked, it seems like the answer is much simpler now. Just update the version that nvm installed, which lives in ~/.nvm/versions/node/[your-version]/lib/node_modules/npm.

I just installed node 4.2.2, which comes with npm 2.14.7, but I want to use npm 3. So I did:

cd ~/.nvm/versions/node/v4.2.2/lib
npm install npm
