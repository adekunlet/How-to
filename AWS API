These are the steps covered since week one, which we will extend on in the final 3 sessions.   If you have any questions, please post them on teams, include your api name, region and the point number you are stuck on.

1. Make a new lambda function and remember the name.
    
2. create an end point with a path param in the middle.
 
3. add that lambda as the integration type
 
4. Add the mapping template
 
5. Give it a POST method
 
6. Enable CORS from the API gateway actions
 
7. Deploy that API
 
8. Make a dynamoDB Table.  with id and an index of family_id (or the secondary id you decided to use in your CSV file)
 
9. Install node (if you havent already)
 
10. put parsedata.js (found in the week 3 teams channel) in the nodedj directory
 
11.  Put cakes.csv file in the same directory and fill it with relevant data
 
12.  Edit parsedata.js to make sure it marries the csv file
 
13.  Edit parsedata.js to your POST end point
 
14.  Edit your Lambda you made in point one and paste in the contents of session_3_upload_object_aws.txt found in Session 3 of serverless on teams
 
15.  Amend that lambda to marry the payload and table name
 
16.  navigate to your local node directory (in command prompt) where parsedata.js is and the csv file
 
17. Type nodejs parsedata.js
 
18. Debug (Teams please)
 
19. Create a new GET endpoint with a path param.
 
20. make a lambda with all steps and paste contents of getItems.txt from teams session 3
 
21.  Use the index.html file as a template and see if you can parse your response (or just get a response to your browser)
